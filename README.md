# Project title - Automatic light controll using IR sensor and arduino :
              
This simple project aims at developing a prototype model which can be used for controlling the lights based on object(Human)
movements. This project can be implemented for scenarios of similar types : Turning on lights when the person is in the room,
Automatic door locking when the person leaves the room.This project makes use of simple code logic and can be further developed
based on specific requirments.


## Prerequisites   

- Digital arduino IR sensor(LM393 chip based) 
- Arduino uno or other Lower end Arduino board
- Arduino IDE (Open source)
- Indicator(LED)

## Installing 

Install the Arduino IDE on any operating system following the official link - https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software

The Digital Arduino IR sensor has three pins :
                gnd pin -> connect to arduino ground
                vcc pin -> connect to arduino vcc(5 volt)
                out pin -> connect to arduino digital pin 12

## Circuit diagram

## Deployment

In the arduino IDE copy the main.ino code from the repository and upload it to the arduino, Make the connections as described in the 
Circuit diagram, Power the arduino with any power source
